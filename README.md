# Mafia Monkeys NFT

Mafia Monkeys is a NFT Collection that brings some monkeys designed by the DALL-E mini AI (https://huggingface.co/spaces/dalle-mini/dalle-mini), an artificial intelligence that can generate images base in what you ask.

This project contains the Mafia Monkeys NFT collection Smart Contract (Solidity) and Frontend (React).

It was made just for practicing and to learn more about Web 3.0, Solidity and the NFT world.

Based on the BuildSpace project "Mint your NFT Collection"
